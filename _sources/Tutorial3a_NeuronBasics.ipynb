This means you can multiply each spike by the neuron action potential shape - dependent on tau (remember that?!) and add them up. At this point, your neuron representation should be approximately the same shape as your input (for a constant value, just a straight line). If you are using one neuron in your ensemble, this should be very similar to your input signal!\n",

Think about it this way: all we see ar spikes coming out of a neuron. How would we know that it's representing negative or positive values? The only think Nengo has to decide that is our encoder. For time varying signals, you'll see how this all works out. But for a constant value, this can become difficult. Should you choose an intercept of .5 and an encoder of -1, the neuron will spike for a value of .25, but it will decode as a negative value (-.25) instead of a postiive value due to the encoder being -1. \n",

    "- Hand tuning every neuron is unreasonable, but if we know something useful about our inputs, we can tweak certain parts of the ensemble and as a result reduce the number of neurons required. For instance, if our inputs will never be negative, we can set encoders to only care about positive values and have all other parameters be random. That way we don't have useless neurons that just don't spike. These are things to consider as you choose how to represent your data.\n",
