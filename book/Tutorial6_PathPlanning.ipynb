    "### Delays using Nengo Nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use a Nengo node to implement an n-timestep delayed connection by using a node. Why a node? Nodes are useful for more complex functions than what we covered in `Tutorial3b`. Why a delay? Often times you want to line up inputs perfectly in time and a delay can make that happen. In the case of Path Planning, we want to use the delay to represent the cost of our map locations. If a map location is more difficult to traverse (i.e. higher cost), then it takes longer to get through - hence a delay. The spike won't emit from that map location until the delay node allows it to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example uses object-oriented programming to set up the delay. You can find a pretty good tutorial on the topic [here](https://www.udacity.com/blog/2021/11/__init__-in-python-an-overview.html). You can also see how `np.roll` works [here](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.roll.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "The class `Delay` starts off with an array called `self.history` of 250 zeros (each time step is `dt=.001` seconds and we want a `time_delay=25` seconds, which is in total 250 time steps). For the first actual time step of the system ($t=1$), the `self.history` array updates to $\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & ... & x(1) \\end{bmatrix}$, but what leaves the node is the first element of the array, 0. This is what we want! We are delaying our signal while storing what will come 250 timesteps later. At the next time step ($t=2$), the `self.history` array updates to $\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & ... & x(1) & x(2) \\end{bmatrix}$. Keep going until time step $t=250$ and you should get the `self.history` array $\\begin{bmatrix} x(1) & x(2) & ... & x(249) & x(250) \\end{bmatrix}$ and the first element $x(1)$ is what leaves the node. That means at time step 250, you're just now seeing the start of the original signal, i.e. you've delayed the signal by 250 timesteps!\n",

    "If you aren't convinced, consider the delay the difficulty of traversal. Example: a map location has a weight / difficulty of 3 which means it'll take 3 seconds to get through said map location. If you place the delay just prior to the map location neuron, the map location will begin firing at the same(ish) time as the delay node. This occurs 3 seconds _after_ it receives a spike from it's neighbor. The output spike will then go to the delay nodes of it's neighbors, which have delays of whatever the neighbor's weights are. Rinse. Repeat."
