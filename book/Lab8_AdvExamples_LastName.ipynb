    "- Implement a learning rule to show how an animal reduces its response to a repeated, benign stimulus (aka habituation)\n",

    "#### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Habituation: This is a form of learning where an animal learns to ignore a stimulus that is neither harmful nor beneficial. For instance, a loud noise may startle a creature initially, but after repeated exposure to the same noise without any negative consequences, the creature's response diminishes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this lab, you will import a baseline stimulus response where the animal hears the loud noise three times. When you plot the data, you should notice that the amplitude of the response is the same every time. This would be the animal's response _if no learning occurred_.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will then implement a learning rule to gradually reduce the animal's response to the stimuli, meaning that by the time the animal hears the noise the third time, the amplitude of the response _after learning_ should be much smaller.\n"
